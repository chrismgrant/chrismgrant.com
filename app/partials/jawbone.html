			At Jawbone, my work primarily consisted of research on behavior tracking and behavior
			change applications and conceptual flows, along with keynote prototypes of interactions for
			proposed features in the Jawbone UP app, namely “Today I Will” — a motivational goal creation
			feature. My other work at Jawbone consisted of front-end development and content updates for
			the Jawbone support site's redesign and troubleshooting guides.
